# Pointer Pointers
A practical C/C++ pointer reference for anyone who has ever had to deal with this crap.

## No seriously, what is it?
Long story short, in my early days of C coding, back when C was already considered a language so old that my grandfather would beat me with a cane for not using an interpreted language, I struggled to figure out some of the practical aspects of pointers. On top of that, there were never any really good sites for figuring any of this out, so in a moment born of frustration and probably alcohol, I decide to write a practical reference for deciphering other people's code, and to save time by not having to try out every possible permutation of pointer symbols while writing my own. The original was lost somewhere while moving jobs and states in the last few years, but here's what I can remember from that version.

I realize by now that anyone who finds this probably isn't writing enterprise software in C/C++ (and God help you if you are), but with a recent giant influx of DIYers and people looking to code for microcontrollers and embedded processors, C looks to be making a comeback in a small way with a lot of people who may not have traditional developer experience.

Hopefully it's half as helpful for you as it was for me.
